Prior to completion of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad there were great anticipations for this area. A number of buildings were altered to provide stores on the ground floor and otherwise placed in good condition. Traffic, however, flowed to Journal Square and the neighborhood suffered rather than benefited. Today it has sunk back to become even more of a blighted area. Large numbers of stores are vacant and man institutionally owned properties are boarded up. Convenience to places of employment and to Manhattan are its only redeeming features. Some 15% of the housing structures are 3's and 4's with a nominal top value of $3200 in which rents per unit are about the same as in doubles. Another 60% are cheap tenements containing 80% of all dwelling units. In these, rooms may be had for $3-3 1/2.

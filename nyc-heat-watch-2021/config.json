Redlining refers to the process by which Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) created 'residential security maps' delineating neighborhoods into different categories to indicate risk levels for giving out loans: A, most desirable (lighter red); B, slightly less desirable; C, declining neighborhoods; D, undesirable (darker red). The categories were assigned primarily based on the neighborhood's socio-demographic composition, and areas with high percentages of low-income immigrant or Black residents were marked as 'D', undesirable, colored in dark red. Redlining is associated with a wide range of present-day adverse outcomes, including disproportionate vulnerability to heat, adverse health outcomes, higher asthma rates, birth outcomes, and cancer diagnoses, among others.

But of course, these spaces aren’t equally accessible to all – communities marginalized along race and class lines face many barriers to accessing public green spaces. These barriers, created largely by systemic racism, have a long history in New York City (NYC) and reveal a clear pattern of environmental injustice. The South Bronx is one of the communities that has little to no public access to green and blue space. And even if there are spaces, nearby industry and waste transfer facilities affect air quality, which is another obstacle to benefitting from green space.",

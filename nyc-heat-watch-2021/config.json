Shade trees are mature street trees that are able to shade surfaces underneath as well as cool the air around them. When urban areas exist without trees, people must get creative to escape extreme heat.

          "content":"Research suggests that the historic, racist patterns of institutionalized discrimination and disinvestment - such as redlining - still manifest in the current landscape of vulnerability to heat across cities in the US. Redlining refers to the process by which Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) created 'residential security maps' delineating neighborhoods into different categories to indicate risk levels for giving out loans: A, most desirable (lighter red); B, slightly less desirable; C, declining neighborhoods; D, undesirable (darker red). The categories were assigned primarily based on the neighborhood's socio-demographic composition, and areas with high percentages of low-income immigrant or Black residents were marked as 'D', undesirable, colored in dark red. Redlining is associated with a wide range of present-day adverse outcomes, including disproportionate vulnerability to heat, adverse health outcomes, higher asthma rates, birth outcomes, and cancer diagnoses, among others.
